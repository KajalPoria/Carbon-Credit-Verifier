# 🌱 AI-Powered Carbon Credit Verifier

> **Code for Energy. Tokenize the Future.**  
> An AI + Blockchain platform that verifies and mints real carbon credits based on renewable energy data.

---

## 🧠 Inspiration
The global carbon market lacks transparency — many carbon credits are unverifiable or double-counted.  
Our goal: **build trust in sustainability** using AI, IoT, and blockchain to automatically validate and tokenize genuine carbon credits.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **IoT sensors** (or simulated data feeds) collect energy production info from renewable sources.  
2. **AI validation engine** analyzes the data to confirm emission reductions and detect anomalies.  
3. **Chainlink oracles** push verified data to a **Polygon smart contract**.  
4. **Smart contracts** mint verified carbon credit tokens (NFT or ERC-20).  
5. **React dashboard** displays real-time metrics and minted token IDs.

## 🧪 How to Test Locally:

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev

#Step 5: Simulate IoT data:

Upload or generate random energy data (CSV/JSON).

Watch live verification and token minting on the dashboard.
